# Delete Task Functionality

This document outlines the delete task functionality that has been implemented across all layers of the application.

## Features

### âœ… **Complete Delete Implementation**

1. **Backend API** (`/api/tasks/[id]`)
   - `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]` - Delete a specific task by ID
   - Proper error handling and authorization checks
   - Returns success/error messages

2. **Service Layer**
   - `TaskApi.deleteTask(taskId)` - Frontend API client
   - `TaskService.deleteTask(taskId)` - Business logic service
   - `TaskRepository.delete(taskId, userId)` - Data access layer

3. **Frontend Components**
   - **TaskCard**: Hover delete button with loading state
   - **TaskDialog**: Delete button in edit mode
   - **ConfirmDialog**: Reusable confirmation dialog
   - **Dashboard**: Orchestrates delete operations

## User Experience

### **Delete Options**

1. **Task Card Delete** (Primary method)
   - Hover over any task card to reveal delete button
   - Click delete button to trigger confirmation dialog
   - Visual feedback with loading spinner during deletion

2. **Task Dialog Delete** (Alternative method)

   - Click delete button in dialog header
   - Confirmation dialog appears

### **Confirmation Flow**

   - Two action buttons: "Cancel" and "Delete"
   - Danger styling (red theme)
   - Cannot be dismissed accidentally

2. **Loading States**

// TaskCard
interface TaskCardProps {
  task: Task;
